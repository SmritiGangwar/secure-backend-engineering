## Method Overriding

- We _cannot_ override the method declared as **final** and **static**.
- Both the superclass and the subclass must have the same method name, the same return type and the same parameter list.

> In Java, annotations are the metadata that we used to provide information to the compiler. 
> Here, the @Override annotation specifies the compiler that the method after this annotation overrides the method of the superclass.
